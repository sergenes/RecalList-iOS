# Prepare the lists
1. Go to the Google Translate site (https://translate.google.com).
2. Use a "save" button #1 every time you've got a translation and you feel that you want to remember this couple of the words or the phrases. 
3. Use a "Show Phrasebook" button #2 and "Export to Google Sheets" button #3 to save all the words and the phrases on your Google Drive.

# To run the app
You need to enable Drive API and Spreadsheet API in Google developer console and to get your own CLIENT_ID for this app. Place it in project in file Secrets.swift.
```groovy
struct Secrets {
    static let CLIENT_ID = "XXX.apps.googleusercontent.com"
}
```
And then you need to define a new URL scheme on the Info tab in XCode, using the same CLIENT_ID of Google API.
```groovy
com.googleusercontent.apps.XXX
```

What needs to be done
=================================
1. Unit and UI testing.
2. Unidirectional flow controller.
3. Shared common module accessed from the both platforms (Kotlin native).
4. Web app.
